This project is a solution for remotely monitoring and controlling a mountain
hut. The main goals are to monitor inside and outside temperatures, COâ‚‚ levels,
and the weather (with a webcam), as well as to control heating to preheat the
hut before going there.

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend and backend, you will need a recent and working version
of `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and edit it variable with **production**
   values:
   
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   vim .env
   ```
   
2. Create a file `traefik/acme.json` and set the mode to `600`:
   
   ```
   touch traefik/acme.json
   chmod 600 traefik/acme.json
   ```
   
3. Start the service with:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Development setup

In order to work on this project on your local machine, you will need a working
installation of `python>=3.7` and recent version of `npm/node.js`.

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and edit it variable with **development**
   values:
   
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   vim .env
   ```
   
2. Open a terminal and run the frontend:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run serve
   ```

   Note: The frontend supports hot-reloads, no need to restart after saving.
   
3. Open a terminal and run the backend:

   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -e .
   python -m hutbee
   ```

   Note: The backend supports hot-reloads, no need to restart after saving.

## Raspberry PI preparation

1. Download and prepare a `Raspberry Pi OS light` SDCard

2. Create an empty `ssh` file and a valid `wpa_supplicant.conf` file in the
   `boot` partition of the SDCard to have Wi-Fi working and SSH enabled

3. Boot the raspberry and set it up (account, password, `sshd_config`, `ufw`)

4. Install `hutbee`, configure `.env` and start the `controller` services.

5. Create the file `/etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0` with the following content:

   ```conf
   allow-hotplug wlan0
   iface wlan0 inet manual
     wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

   iface default inet dhcp
   ```

## Docker security config

1. Disable docker playing with `iptables` by editing `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service`:

   ```conf
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --iptables=false
   ```

2. Enable ufw forwarding for docker by adding this at the beginning of
   `/etc/ufw/before.rules`:

   ```conf
   *nat
   :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
   -A POSTROUTING ! -o docker0 -s 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
   COMMIT
   ```

3. Enable packet forwarding by uncommenting this in `/etc/ufw/sysctl.conf`:

   ```conf
   net/ipv4/ip_forward=1
   ```

4. Allow traffic from docker subnetworks:

   ```conf
   $ sudo ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12
   ```
